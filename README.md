# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This is the final project for Week 4 of the Getting and Cleaning Data Course.
The goal of this project is to demontrate the students' ability to work with an initial data set, and present the data in a clean and easily readible manner.

## Data
The dataset used for this project can be found [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

## Files
The following files are provided for this project:

1. codebook.md: This file describes the variables, data, and work done to clean up the data
2. run_analysis.R: This is the R script that performs the objectives for this project (outlined below):
   - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
   - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
   - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
   - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
   - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
3. data.txt: This is the exported tidy dataset
